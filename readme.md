# Phoenix WP Theme

A lean, mean WP theme. Work-In-Progress. For now, it's not even a proper WP theme - it's some pure and basic HTML and CSS that will set up the pillars of what the theme itself will be. Sometime in the - I hope not too distant - future.

## Some backstory...

I designed http://unregistered.gr's and http://pipesmag.com's main theme, titled "Core", ages ago. It remains a fluid, versatille theme that's visually closer to a proper mag than most of the "magazine themes" out there. But some things were lacking: it depended on some plugins (for no real reason bar my inexperience to taming and extending WP through PHP) and was practically a behemoth of rules upon rules, with other rules canceling some of those rules, with even more extra rules sprinkled on top, changing stuffs. Far from what you'd call optimal.

After a nasty hack sent both sites (and some extra co-hosted ones) offline, and after having neglected updating them for years, I decided it was time for a reboot. And this is it: a leaner, meaner theme that should, for all intends and purposes, look and work in a similar way to the "Core" variants before it. But better. In each and every way.

I dunno if and when it will be finished - I've got other priorities in life right now. But I *had* to stop perpetually postponing it.

## Getting Started

Load the main index.html into your browser to see how everything's looking up to now, and how any WP site will look in the future when using this theme.

### Prerequisites

None for now. We'll see if anything extra is needed. I'll try to keep everything simple and avoid using *any* addons if it isn't really necessary.

This *will* mean that, in the long run, I consider better (and the theme will demand) editing some files to change some parameters manually instead of having to add needless fluff on a WP instalation, needlesly draging things down.

### Installing

Nothing for now. It's the equivalent of a non-working "static" HTML page. Will be "WordPress-ized" when we reach a point where that's possible.

## Built With

* Sublime Text 3 editor
* Firefox (Nightly)
* LESS & SASS for quicker initial setup
* Lots of coffee

## Contributing

Feel free to message me if you care to lend a hand in the theme's development. PHP's not my strong point, so if anyone wants to deal with that part, I'm open. Page me.

## Authors

* Odysseas Kourafalos - aka: Ducklord

## License

This project is licensed under no License for now - this is something I didn't have the time to deal with. To keep things simple, "you can use it if you mention, with links, what it is, where you found it and who made it in the footer of your site". Since, for now, it's useless as a "real theme" for WP sites, I don't think you'd really care "using it".

## Acknowledgments
