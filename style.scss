Theme Name: Core Phoenix
Theme URI: https://github.com/Derducken/unregistered_phoenix
Author: Odysseas Kourafalos (aka: Ducklord)
Author URI: http://unregistered.gr
Description: The Ultimate "magazine theme", responsive, fluid, easily customizable and extendable. I studied Graphic Design but worked for decades as a writer for tech mags. Then, jumped to the vast web. This combination allows me to create a theme that combines the best of all those worlds - nice design *and* easy to manage "as a writer" *and* easy to customize and extend as a web designer/dev. Enjoy!

License: Didn't have time to think about this - yet. What would a "feel free to do whatever you want, but point back towards the original code and me - and if you somehow end up making megabucks with this, drop me a dime" be in the world of licenses?
